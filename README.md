## Game Features

- **Graphics and Interface**: Utilizes OpenGL for rendering, creating an engaging 2D/3D environment. The game window is set at 1000x700 pixels.
- **Multiple Bullet Types**: There are different types of bullet. After every fireshoot a random bullet from thedifferent bullet types: Simple, Explosive, Sniper, and Burst, each with unique behaviors is assigned to a player.
- **Interactive Terrain**: The terrain interacts with the gameplay, changing over time due to game actions.
- **Player Turns**: The game employs a turn-based system where players alternate turns to attack.
- **Health and Energy System**: Each robot is equipped with health and energy meters that affect their gameplay (movemet and jumping) capabilities.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Implements basic physics for bullet trajectories and robot movements.
- **Collision Detection**: Essential for determining impacts between bullets, players, and the terrain.
- **Projectile Motion**: Calculates the trajectories of bullets using principles of physics.
- **Random Generation**: Used for terrain features and other randomized game elements.
